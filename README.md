# Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java Relearning and Mastery Journey. This repository documents my process of revisiting, enhancing, and mastering Java, one of the most versatile and widely-used programming languages. As someone with prior experience in Java, this journey is about solidifying my foundations, exploring advanced topics, and building real-world projects to elevate my skills.

My focus is on deepening my understanding of core concepts while tackling advanced topics like Spring Boot, JavaFX, JWT authentication, and REST APIs. This repository serves as a log of my progress, resources, and projects along the way.
