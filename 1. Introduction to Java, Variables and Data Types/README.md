# Learning Java: Introduction, Variables, and Data Types

Welcome to my Java learning journey. This repository contains examples and exercises that I've worked on to deepen my understanding of Java programming. Below, you'll find a summary of what I've learned and some of the key concepts I've explored.

## Introduction

This repository documents my journey as I explore the basics of Java programming, including how to display text, use comments, escape sequences, and perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Hello World: Displaying Text

Learned how to display text using the `System.out.println` method in Java.

Example:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
        System.out.println("Hello, Chris");
        System.out.println("Hello, Programmer");
    }
}
```

## Print vs Println: Comments and Escape Sequences

Explored the difference between `System.out.print` and `System.out.println`, and used comments and escape sequences.

Example:
```java
public class PrintVsPrintln {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
        System.out.print("Hello, Chris");

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println();

        // Escape Sequence with \n
        System.out.println("Hello, \nWorld");
        System.out.println("Welcome");
    }
}
```

## Numbers and Math

Learned how to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Example:
```java
public class NumbersAndMath {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Addition");
        System.out.println(4 + 2);
        
        System.out.println("Subtraction");
        System.out.println(5 - 2);

        System.out.println("Multiplication");
        System.out.println(5 * 2);

        System.out.println("Division");
        System.out.println(10 / 2);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This sandbox has been an excellent resource for exploring the basics of Java programming. I look forward to building more complex projects with these foundational skills. If you find this repository helpful, feel free to explore and use these examples as a reference for your own learning
